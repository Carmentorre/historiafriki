__This is only a test__ in preparation for the digital archive I want to create on Cuban Frikis. I have previously built an Omeka site on [Cuban punk](http://punkcubano.net/) where anyone interested can listen to some underground music! Here is a video from one of my favorite Cuban punk bands, Adictox (although the song is actually a cover from Spain's own Eskorbuto)

I am forever grateful to Alex and Marii for teaching us all the basics of **Wax**.

The collection items in this demo were collected by our team (The Oaks) and were built upon work previously done by our teammate Kijan.
