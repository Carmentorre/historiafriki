**The Oaks work on Slavery in the Caribbean**   
My team, The Oaks, worked together to create this project for our Minimal Computing course. We have built a small archive using images and data that our teammate Kijan provided, and have worked together to troubleshoot and publish our sites throughout the week!

**Historia Friki**  
On a personal note, I have worked on this site in preparation for a digital archive I want to create on Cuban Frikis. Frikis (a sort of umbrella term used to define all fans of rock and its subgenres in Cuba) were the first underground music culture to appear in the island in the early 1980s. They soon became infamous because of their rebellious attitude and their taste for Anglo-American music, and were subject to constant state repression. With this archive, I want to build a visual history that helps preserve their legacy.

**Beyond Frikis**

My work on Cuban underground cultures is part of my dissertation research. I have previously built an Omeka site on [Cuban punk](http://punkcubano.net/) where anyone interested can listen to some underground music! Here is a video from one of my favorite Cuban punk bands, Adictox (although the song is actually a cover from Spain's own Eskorbuto)
